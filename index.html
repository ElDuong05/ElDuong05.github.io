            <h2><em>Where I'm From</em></h2>
            <p> I was born and raised in California, San Jose wondering what I wanted to do in my life. My most top priority was to going to a college where my talents are appreciates. I was challeged everyday at school to try my hardest no matter what the situation is.</p>
            <h2><em>What I Want to Do in My Life</em></h2>
            <p>I have thought alot about this question my whole life and have finally found an answer in 6th grade. I have chosen to be a videogame designer when I grow up. I really like videogames alot but I also like drawing as a hobby. I combined them not just to be a hobby, but my future lifetime job.</p>
